Originally I found this at https://codepen.io/denic/pen/GRoOxbM but I wanted to make it in a react component that autoscales with more text.

Now you can run this  

```
import Typing from './components/typing'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
    <Typing text='Hi my name is Ian.' />
    <h1>more text</h1>
    </div>

  );
}

export default App;
```
